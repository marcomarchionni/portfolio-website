          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <h4 class="paragraph-title">Overview</h4>
          <p>
            <a href="https://flix-it.netlify.app/" target="_blank">FlixIt</a> is
            a web application that provides information about movies from the
            Golden Age of Italian Cinema (1960-1980). Users can register, login,
            edit their profile, search movies, and create a list of favourites.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of the project was to give visibility to a curated
            selection of Italian Classics that are often overlooked and
            underrepresented on the web and almost forgotten by the younger
            generations. FlixIt may serve as a valuable platform for students,
            movie enthusiasts, and admirers of Italian culture to rediscover and
            appreciate these gems from the past.

          <p>
            This project is part of the CareerFoundry full-stack development
            course. The aim is to design, create and deploy a full-stack
            application using the latest technologies.
          </p>
          <h4 class="paragraph-title">Duration</h4>
          <p>
            The duration of this project was approximately 2 months: 1 month for
            the backend, 1 month for the frontend.
          </p>
          <h4>A Full-Stack Application</h4>
          <p>
            A full-stack application consists of two parts: the frontend and the
            backend. The frontend is the interface through which users interact
            while the backend handles the frontend requests, including user
            authentication, data validation, database connection, and data
            management.
          </p>
          <h4 class="paragraph-title">The Frontend</h4>
          <h4 class="small-paragraph-title">React</h4>
          <p>
            React is a powerful JavaScript library developed by Meta for
            creating dynamic web applications. Unlike a traditional static
            website, a web application can produce HTML content dynamically at
            request time, which allows for personalised experiences for each
            user.
          </p>
          <h4 class="small-paragraph-title">React Components</h4>
          <p>
            To understand how React works, let’s examine our Flixit main page
            from <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>.
          </p>
          <figure id="figure-1" class="centered-figure">
            <img
              src="img/flixit-app-screenshot-16:10.png"
              alt="FlixIt Main Page"
              width="100%"
            />
            <figcaption>Figure 1. Flixit main page</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            We can identify several visual elements, such as
            <b>movie cards</b> displaying movie information, two
            <b>buttons</b> under the movie titles and a <b>search box</b> in the
            top-left corner.
          </p>
          <p>
            React enables us to build complex web applications by organising
            them into multiple components. These components can be further
            broken down into smaller components, making them easier to code,
            test, manage, and reuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            A React component visual appearance may vary according to its data.
            For example, the favourite button may display a white star or with a
            black star (<a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>).
          </p>
          <figure id="figure-2" class="centered-figure">
            <img
              src="img/case-study/flixit-favorite-button.png"
              alt="FlixIt favorite button"
              width="300px"
            />
            <figcaption>Figure 2. Favourite button</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The button appearance is determined by a special state variable
            called <b>favourite</b>. If the movie is among the user’s
            favourites, <b>favourite</b> is set to “true” and a black star icon
            is displayed on the button. Otherwise, the star will be white. Here
            is a code snippet from the StarButton component:
          </p>
          <pre>
              <code>
  &lt;Button&gt;
    {favourite ? &lt;StarFill className="bi" /&gt; : &lt;Star className="bi"/&gt;}
  &lt;/Button&gt;
              </code>
            </pre>
          <p>
            Let’s now examine the MovieCard component, which is responsible for
            rendering a movie card like the one in
            <a href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>. Inside the MovieCard component, a
            <i>state</i> variable called <b>movie</b> contains information about
            the movie poster and title, determining the appearance of the card.
            Two nested components, StarButton and InfoButton, are included at
            the bottom of the card.
          </p>
          <figure id="figure-3" class="centered-figure">
            <img
              src="img/case-study/flixit-movie-card.png"
              alt="FlixIt movie card"
              width="300px"
            />
            <figcaption>Figure 3. Movie Card</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h4 class="small-paragraph-title">React Redux</h4>
          <p>
            As we already mentioned, the <i>state</i> variable
            <b>favourite</b> controls the appearance of the StarButton
            component. But how is this variable set? How do the component know
            if the movie on the card is a user’s favourite?
          </p>
          <p>
            To solve the problem, the component needs access to the user’s list
            of favourites, which is stored in the variable <b>user</b>. This
            data is retrieved from the backend by the LoginView component when a
            user logs in. In React, data is typically passed from a parent
            component to a child component through parameters called props. In
            this case, however, passing the variable <b>user</b> from the
            LoginView component to the MovieCard and StarButton components can
            be cumbersome and error-prone, due to the length of traversal path
            (<a href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a>).
          </p>
          <figure id="figure-4" class="centered-figure">
            <img
              src="img/case-study/flixit-components-diagram.png"

              width="100%"
            />
            <figcaption>Figure 4. Components Diagram</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            To address this issue, we can leverage React Redux. Redux is a state
            management technology that simplifies access to global variables for
            React components. With React Redux, variables are saved in a
            centralised store, which can be easily accessed from any component
            (<a href="#figure-5">Figure 5</a>).
          </p>
          <figure id="figure-5" class="centered-figure">
            <img
              src="img/case-study/flixit-redux-diagram.png"
              alt="FlixIt redux diagram"
              width="100%"
            />
            <figcaption>Figure 5. Redux Diagram</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            When a user logs in, the LoginView component saves the variable
            <b>user</b> in the Redux store and redirects to the main page.
            Before rendering, each MovieCard component accesses the variable
            <b>user</b>, checks if the movie is a favourite and passes the
            result to the StarButton. The StarButton updates its state
            accordingly. If this value is true, a black star icon will be
            displayed on the button.
          </p>
          <h4 class="paragraph-title">Backend</h4>
          <h4 class="small-paragraph-title">The data flow</h4>
          <p>
            In the previous section, we discussed how data may affect the
            frontend appearance. Now let’s examine where the data is stored and
            how it flows through the different parts of the application (<a
              href="#figure-6"
              >Figure 6</a
            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a simple scenario: after a user logs in, a collection of
            movie cards appear on the screen. How does this process occur?
          </p>
          <figure id="figure-6" class="centered-figure">
            <img
              src="img/case-study/flixit-data-flow.png"
              alt="FlixIt data flow"
              width="100%"
            />
            <figcaption>Figure 6. Data flow</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The frontend doesn’t hold any user or movie data. Instead, data is
            stored in a MongoDb Atlas cloud database, which is connected to a
            Node.js/Express backend. To access the data, the frontend sends a
            HTTP request to
            <a href="https://itflix-api.herokuapp.com/documentation"
              >one of the backend’s API endpoints</a
            >. In our scenario, to retrieve the list of all movies, the frontend
            sends a GET request to the following endpoint:
          </p>
          <pre>
              <code>
  https://&lt;flixit-api-domain&gt;/movies
              </code>
            </pre>
          <p>
            If the request is authorised*, the backend retrieves the data from a
            MongoDb Atlas cloud database and includes it in the response body in
            JSON format. Here is an example of a JSON object containing
            information about a movie.
          </p>
          <pre>
              <code>
  {
    "title": "A Fistful of Dollars",
    "director": {
      "name": "Sergio Leone",
      "born": "1929-01-03",
      "died": "1989-04-30",
      "bio": "..."
    },
    "stars": [
      {
        "name": "Clint Eastwood",
        "born": "1930-05-31",
        "bio": "..."
      },
      {
        ...
      }
    ],
    "genre": {
      "name": "Spaghetti Western",
      "description": "..."
    }
    "year": "1964",
    "posterUrl": "...",
    "photoUrl": "..."
    ...
  }              
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            The frontend is now able to render the page. Each movie data is
            assigned to a MovieCard component which displays the relevant
            information. The final result is visible in
            <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            * The request must provide a valid security token and its origin
            should be allowed
          </p>
          <h4 class="paragraph-title">Conclusions</h4>
          <h4 class="small-paragraph-title">Retrospective</h4>
          <p>
            Building a web application with the MERN stack (MongoDb, Express,
            React, Nodejs) was made relatively easy due to the abundance of
            libraries, resources and online documentation available.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project presented some challenges that were overcome through
            valuable learning experiences. In particular:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Managing dependencies and finding the right combination of tools
              and libraries to ensure compatibility and functionality required
              thorough investigation and problem-solving skills. Although this
              aspect may not be the most thrilling, it is an essential skill for
              web development.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the number of React components grows, maintaining a clear
              application flow becomes increasingly challenging. To mitigate
              this, organising files and folders, and categorising components
              based on their function proved crucial. Maintaining a tidy and
              structured codebase prepares the application for scalability.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="small-paragraph-title">Further improvements</h4>
          <p>
            While FlixIt currently stands as a full-fledged web application, its
            functionalities remain relatively basic. Here are a few ideas to
            enhance the user experience further:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Introduce Director and Genre Views to provide information about
              directors and genres.
            </li>
            <li>
              Include a “Where to watch” section in movie details, linking
              online platforms for buying, renting, or streaming the movie.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide external resource links such as articles or blog posts.
            </li>
            <li>Expand and enrich the movie selection in the database.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="small-paragraph-title">About this case study</h4>
          <p>
            The case study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
            Flixit app, catering to individuals with varying technical
            knowledge. While we have covered only a portion of the app's
            functionalities for the sake of simplicity, it is worth highlighting
            some key aspects for further discussion:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              User Authentication leverages
              <a href="https://www.passportjs.org/">Passport</a>, a powerful
              authentication middleware, to ensure secure user registration,
              login, and session management.
            </li>
            <li>
              The backend effectively manages database connection and data
              modelling using <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a>, a
              solution that simplifies data management for Node.js and MongoDb.
            </li>
            <li>
              The app utilises
              <a href="https://reactrouter.com/en/main">React Router</a> for
              page navigation and routing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Component styling is made easier and more consistent through the
              use of
              <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React Bootstrap</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
